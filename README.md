# NanoPulse - A Precision 24-bit Pulse Capture Digitizer

This is part of a precision pulse capture system, designed for characterization of lasers and high-speed power semiconductor validation (HEMT, SiC, GaN).

**This enables capture and validation of:**
- Pulse shape and timing
- Rise and fall characteristics
- Droop and settling behavior
- Overshoot and transient response
