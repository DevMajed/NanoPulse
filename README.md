**NanoPulse - A Precision 24-bit Pulse Capture Digitizer
**  

This is Part of a precision pulse capture system, designed for characterization  
of lasers and High-speed power semiconductor validation (HEMT, SiC, GaN)  


This will enables capture and validation of:
	• Pulse shape and timing
	• Rise and fall characteristics
	• Droop and settling behavior
	• Overshoot and transient response
